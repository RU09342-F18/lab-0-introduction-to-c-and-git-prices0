# How to Use
The math.h and math.c files are files that will be used later in a UART Calculator. This is a basic math calculator including some bitwise operations.
Operations included are:
'+' to add two numbers (num1, num2)
'-' to subtract two numbers (num1. num2)
'*' to multiply two numbers (num1, num2)
'/' to divide two numbers (num1. num2)
'%' to find the modulus "remainder from the division" of two numbers (num1, num2)
'<' to shift left num1 by num2
'>' to shift right num1 by num2
'&' to bitwise and two numbers (num1, num2)
'|' to bitwise or two numbers (num1. num2)
'^' to bitwise xor two numbers (num1, num2)
'~' to bitwise inverse num1

# Inputs
These files take three inputs, the first number, second number, and the operator. The operator is used to determine which operation will be done on the two numbers. In the case ther operations '~' is entered only the first number1, num1, will be affected.
